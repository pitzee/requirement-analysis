## üß† What is Requirement Analysis?

**Requirement Analysis** is the process of identifying, gathering, and documenting the functional and non-functional requirements of a software system. It serves as the foundation for designing, developing, and testing software that meets users‚Äô needs and business goals.

This phase involves close collaboration between stakeholders, such as clients, end-users, project managers, and software engineers. Techniques like interviews, questionnaires, workshops, and document analysis are often used to extract detailed requirements.

### üîç Importance in the SDLC

Requirement analysis plays a crucial role in the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** because:

- It ensures a clear understanding of what the system must do.
- It helps avoid costly rework by catching issues early.
- It aligns the development team‚Äôs efforts with business objectives.
- It provides a basis for project planning, design, coding, and testing.
